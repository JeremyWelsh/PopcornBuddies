# Popcorn Buddies
This React Native Movie review app I developed, was for the Victoria Universtiy Course SWEN325.
The requirements were to utilize a database component (I used Firebase), and an external component (I used the TMDB API)
To run the app, you need to install Expo and Node JS, and then type npm start in the terminal.
